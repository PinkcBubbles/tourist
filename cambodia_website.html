  <h2 style="color:#800000;">🌏 Geography of Cambodia</h2>
  <p>
    Cambodia is located in mainland Southeast Asia. Its land is mostly low plains with the 
    Tonlé Sap Lake and the Mekong River at its center. These water systems made the land fertile 
    and excellent for rice farming. The mountains in the west and north protected the people 
    and influenced the development of the Khmer Empire.

  <h2 style="color:#800000;">🏯 History and Culture</h2>
  <p>
    The Khmer Empire (9th–15th century) became one of the most powerful kingdoms in Asia. 
    It was built around Angkor, where temples like Angkor Wat show the greatness of Khmer 
    art, religion, and engineering. Cambodia’s history was shaped by its rivers, 
    which supported trade, farming, and cultural exchange.

  <h2 style="color:#800000;">🎭 Traditions and Way of Life</h2>
  <p>
    Cambodian culture is deeply influenced by Buddhism and Hinduism. Traditional dance, 
    silk weaving, and festivals are linked to the seasons and farming life. 
    The water festival, Bon Om Touk, celebrates the rivers and the reversal of the Tonlé Sap River.
